# Sophie Germain Prime

1. Find random 32-bit Sophie Germain Prime Q and associated Prime P =  2*Q+1.

2. Find the smallest integer g in ZP* that generates the subgroup G of ZP*, where |G| = Q.

3. Use P, Q, g (from 1 and 2), and verify the following for random a, b from ZQ:

     i) Calculate x = ga (mod P) and y = gb (mod P).

     ii) Verify xb (mod P) is equal to ya (mod P).
